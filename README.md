## üß† The Matching Algorithm

The power of **Career Spark** lies in its matching logic. It goes beyond simple keyword matching and uses a weighted system to create a holistic user profile.

1.  **User Profiling:** The user's answers are mapped to the **RIASEC (Holland Codes) model**‚ÄîRealistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional.
2.  **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** The algorithm also considers preferences for work environment (structured vs. dynamic), motivational drivers (autonomy, social impact), and core values.
3.  **Similarity Calculation:** It calculates a Euclidean distance between the user's profile and the profile of each of the 50 careers in its database. This determines a precise "alignment score."
4.  **Personalized Feedback:** The results page dynamically generates reasons for each match by comparing the user's strongest traits with the primary characteristics of the recommended career.
